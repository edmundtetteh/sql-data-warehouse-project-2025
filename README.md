## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, a layered approach for scalable and maintainable data pipelines:

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

### 🔹 Bronze Layer
Raw data ingested **as-is** from CSV files into SQL Server. This layer supports auditability and replay.

### 🔸 Silver Layer
Data is **cleaned, standardized, and normalized** to prepare it for analysis. Transformation logic is applied here.

### 🟡 Gold Layer
Business-ready, **analytics-optimized** data modeled into **star schemas** (fact and dimension tables) for dashboards and reports.
